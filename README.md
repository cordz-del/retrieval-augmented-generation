# retrieval-augmented-generation

This repository contains resources on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, including a pre-trained RAG model that combines a retriever and a generator. RAG techniques are used to enhance text generation by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external sources.

## Overview

The repository provides a pre-trained RAG model that can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, text summarization, and knowledge-based text generation.

## Contents

- **pre-trained RAG model (retriever plus gener...)**: A pre-trained RAG model that combines a retriever and a generator for enhanced text generation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Load the pre-trained RAG model using your preferred programming language or framework.
3. Use the model for text generation tasks by providing input queries and retrieving relevant information from external sources.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with natural language processing and text generation techniques.
- Access to external data sources for retrieval (e.g., a knowledge base or document collection).
